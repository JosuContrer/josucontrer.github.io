        description: 
            <p>Four projects where implemented using the <b>WebGL JavaScript Library.</b> Used the <b>graphics pipeline</b> to manipulate vertices of objects calculated by the computers <b>GPU</b> and displayed on the browser. Other topics covered in the projects where <b>ray tracing vs rasterization</b>, texture, <b>Chaikus algorithm and Bezier Curve,</b> Fractals, lighting algorithms (Phong Interpolation vs Gouraud Shading), reflection and refraction, and back-face culling.</p>,

                <ul>
                    <li>1) <b>Web Paint</b> – Web browser canvas that can load .bat files and draw vectors.</li>
                    <li>2) <b>Mesh Viewer</b> – 3D program that loads a mesh object form a .ply file and animates by rotation, translation, and pulsation transformations.</li>
                    <li>3) <b>Kinematic Sculpture</b> – Sculpture that uses hierarchical modeling to assign parent child relationships that allows group transformations.</li>
                    <li>4) <b>Ray Tracer</b> – Three different scenes rendered using a set amount of ray tracing iterations for more accurate depiction of 3D scenes.</li>
